    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> Looking at photographs has always been an interest for me. I started taking photos with my phone of things I found interesting. I got my first camera after 8th grade graduation. I started taking photography seriously and taught myself. I had the Canon Rebel T6 which came with two other lens in the package. I started out with photographing nature and landscape photography. I was always interested in taking photos of things like sunsets and anything outside. I also used my younger brother sometimes to model for me so I could experiment with portraits. I used that camera throughout highschool to learn photography and find my style. I went through different stages with my photography figuring out what I liked to photograph.</p>
    <p> At first it was just a hobby but I started seeing it as a possible career. Throughout highschool I had to figure out what I would want to major in college. I saw photography as a good choice for me as a major. I started doing little jobs like photographing my brothers baseball games. Photographing the games gave me the ability to know how to photograph fast moving objects. I also wanted to do something for the parents and kids because its always nice to have photos of an event. I realized I could make a career out of it so I applied to Seton Hill for the Graphic Design-Photography major. Towards my senior year my photography had gotten better and expanded. I did landscape, nature, sports, portraits, architecture, candids, street, film, still life, black and white, double exposure photography. I'm still building my areas on photography to my portfolio. I have fun having all of the creativity with my camera and building images.</p>
    <p>I realized since I would be doing photography for awhile, I wanted to get an upgrade from my camera. In December 2022, I got the Canon 5D Mark IV which was a big upgrade from the Canon Rebel T6. I wanted something that would give the ability to capture things better. I also got a telephoto lens because I knew I would be doing sports photography for my brothers games. Using my new camera has a been a huge upgrade and has allowed me to capture things I couldn't before. I was able to capture the moon clearly which I couldn't capture well before. My new camera has settings that are so much better than my old camera like ISO being higher. I have a film camera too and some point and shoots which I'm still learning about film and how to use it.I like to go to fleatiques and thrift stores and find old cameras to collect. Some are usuable and some are not so the others I put on display.</p>
    <p>I started to make my own brand which is <b>Kassidycaptures</b>. In the future I would love to have my own studio and business. I'm slowly doing the steps to get it started. I started an instagram to showcase my photography so it could be like an online portfolio. Eventually I want to make a website so people could book me through there. I want to be able to sell prints in the future of the landscape, nature, etc that I photograph. I would also like to expand my brand and do videography for sporting events or anything in the future. I'm interested in cinemaphotgraphy too and would love to make short films in the future.</p>
